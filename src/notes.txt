* Introducing JSX
  * Elements: JSX produces React "elements"
  * You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside JSX curly braces
  * It is best practice to wrap JSX in parentheses when splitting over multiple lines
  * After "compilation" <-- research further ***, JSX elements become JavaScript function calls that evalute to objects
  * Element attributes can be specified within quotes or curly braces, but not both
